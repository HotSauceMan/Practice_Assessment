# Practice_Assessment
This is a practice analysis for my data analyst assessment.
You will see the following graphs in a different file, since my R Markdown file was not knitting (and I had ran out of the 4 hour time limit by then). 
The code will be located in the analysis.rmd file. 
I labeled the graph title according to the code and my short analysis is right beneath the graph!
