# Practice_Assessment
This is a practice analysis for my data analyst assessment.
You will see the following graphs in a different file, since my R Markdown file was not knitting (and I had ran out of the 4 hour time limit by then). 
The code will be located in the analysis.rmd file. 
I labeled the graph title according to the code and my short analysis is right beneath the graph!

Here is the code to graph breakdown of this github:

lines 29-30 -> plot with abline

lines 57-58 -> October 21-30 density plot

lines 69-70 -> October 1-10 density plot

lines 78-79 -> Overall density plot of the month. 

lines 87-88 -> duration to likes of geom_point graph. 

lines 95-96 -> duration to comment of geom_line graph. 

line 103 -> pie chart of projects added.

line 110 -> barplot of projects added to log in entries

lines 116-118 -> 3D pie chart of amount of projects added.
